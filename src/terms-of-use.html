					<h1>Terms of Use</h1>
					<div>
						<h2>Introduction</h2>
						<p>These conditions ("the Conditions") govern the use of the goods and services (jointly referred to as "the Services")
							offered by Shadow US (“Shadow US”)– in particular, access to Shadow®, a service which provides subscription access
							to a
							remote personal computer, and use of the website shadow.tech, and all other websites of Shadow US and its affiliates
							("the Websites"). They constitute a contract between you ("the User") and Shadow US (jointly referred to as "the
							Parties"). These Conditions, as well as the Confidentiality Policy and the Cookies Charter must be accepted to
							access
							the Services.</p>
						<p>Please read these Conditions carefully. By using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Conditions, including
							the
							Confidentiality Policy, the Cookies Charter and the Code of Conduct herein, and all other terms and policies
							incorporated herein by reference. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THESE TERMS, DO NOT USE THIS WEBSITE OR OUR
							SERVICES.</p>
						<p>IMPORTANT: THESE CONDITIONS CONTAIN A BINDING ARBITRATION PROVISION, WHICH INCLUDES A WAIVER OF THE USER RIGHT TO
							BRING
							CLAIMS AS CLASS ACTIONS AND THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF THE FOREGOING PROVISION. THESE PROVISIONS AFFECT USER’S RIGHTS
							UNDER
							THESE CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO ALL SERVICES.</p>
						<p>Some of the Services offered by Shadow US may, where applicable, be subject to special conditions, which once
							accepted
							by the User will supplement and prevail over these Conditions for the Services concerned.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h2>Definitions</h2>

							the
							plural, or unless the context otherwise requires or except as otherwise expressly provided, the Parties have agreed
							on
							the following definitions:</p>
						<p>"Intellectual Property Assets" refers to intellectual works protected by the provisions of French and international
							intellectual property law and, in particular, the Websites and Software.</p>
						<p>"Third-Party Applications" refers to third-party software, applications, websites and services that are included in
							the
							Services or may be accessed, purchased or subscribed to through the Services.</p>

						<p>"Subscription Start Date" refers to the date the Shadow® remote computer is put into service.</p>

					</div>
					<div>
						<h2>Capacity</h2>
						<p>The Services are not intended for, and may not be used by people under the age of 13. By using the Services, the User
							represents and warrants to Shadow US that he/she has at least 13 years of age and is lawfully able to accept these
							Conditions, and purchase and/or use the Services.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h2>Identification Documentation</h2>
						<p>To take out a subscription, Shadow US may ask the User to provide a copy of his or her valid identification document
							or
							any other proof of identity, before the start of or during the subscription. The User has ten (10) calendar days to
							send
							Shadow US any documents requested starting from the date of the first request.</p>
						<p>If the User does not meet this condition, Shadow US may refuse his or her subscription request, or may suspend or
							cancel
							the subscription without prior notice if it has already started, in which case the subscription fee will be due
							until
							the date of cancellation.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h2>Shadow</h2>
						<p>Shadow® offers the User access to a remote personal computer by <a href="#">subscription</a>.</p>
						<p>This computer works in a similar way to a standard PC in that Users can install their own software and store their own
						data and content, which are available every time they connect to the device. Users can also link it to compatible
						peripherals (printers, joysticks, etc.). Unless indicated otherwise as part of the <a href="#">Service subscription</a>, the operating
						system for this computer is Windows 10 Home.</p>
						<p>Shadow® may be accessed using several devices (PCs, tablets, mobile telephones, smart TVs) ("a Third-Party Terminal")
						which run on an operating system for which Shadow US has developed and made available a software for (jointly referred
						to as "the Software"). Shadow US does not guarantee that a Software for a specific third-party operating system will
						remain available at all time during the Subscription Period.</p>
						<p>For an optimal experience, Shadow® may also be accessed using a <a href="#">specific terminal</a> developed by Shadow US ("the
						Terminal"). This Terminal (for example, the Shadow Ghost Terminal), must be connected to a screen and a keyboard and/or
						a mouse, which are not provided by Shadow US unless indicated otherwise.</p>
						<p>Technically, in both cases, the User's inputs (keystrokes, moving the mouse, etc.) are sent from the Terminal or
						Third-Party Terminal to Shadow US's computer servers which process the information received and send a signal to the
						Terminal or Third-Party Terminal which enables it to display the image and play the corresponding sound on the User's
						screen. For Shadow® to operate, the User must, therefore, be connected to the Internet, such <a href="#">Internet connection</a> costs
						resting fully with the User.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h2>Shadow Subscription</h2>
						<p>The duration of subscription chosen by the User will be calculated from the date his or her Shadow® remote personal
						computer is put into service ("the Subscription Start Date", which may also be referred to as the activation date).</p>
						<p>The subscription will continue from the Subscription Start Date for a one-month period ("the Subscription Period").</p>
						<p>Unless otherwise specified during the subscription of the Service, and unless the User has not cancelled his or her
						subscription the day before it ends, at the latest, through actions available on his or her User Account, or at least
						ten (10) days before it ends if the request has been made by any other means made available to the User (postal letter,
						message to the Support Department etc.), it will be automatically renewed without notice, to the extent legally
						permissible, for the same term as the current Subscription Period and under the same conditions, unless the conditions
						have been amended by Shadow US. It is understood that the abovementioned timings mean from the receipt of the request by
						Shadow US, and not from the date of the request being sent.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h2>Subscription Fee</h2>
						<p>The cost of the Services is the price indicated to the User when taking out the subscription.</p>
						<p>Shadow US shall inform the User if it wishes to change the price of the Services, by giving a reasonable period of
						notice before the date the change takes effect. In the case of price increases, Users will therefore be required to
						agree to the new price conditions if they intend to continue their subscription contract after the date the new
						conditions take effect. They can do so via the pop-up containing a description of the new conditions and which appears
						the first time the User connects after Shadow US has adopted the new price conditions, if applicable, or through any
						other means Shadow US chose to inform the User. If the User has not agreed to the new price conditions by the date they
						take effect, Shadow US may, at its sole discretion, (a) cancel the subscription at the end of the current Subscription
						Period on the date the new conditions take effect, (b) keep on providing the Services at the same price, or (c)
						transition the User subscription to the plan which is most similar to the User then-current subscription.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h2>Payment Dates</h2>
						<p>Users who take out a one (1) month subscription will be charged the amount of the subscription on the date it is taken
						out. If their monthly subscription is renewed, the payment for the following month will be deducted one month after the
						date of subscription. If the subscription is extended, the monthly payments will then be deducted every month on the
						same date.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h2>Online Payments</h2>
						<h3>Method of payment</h3>
						<div>
							<p>The cost of the Services may be paid online by bank card or any other means indicated on the Websites. Payments by
								bank
								cards will be debited immediately after the User's details have been verified, and once debit authorisation has been
								received from the company that issued the bank card used by the User. In accordance with applicable law, the
								commitment
								to pay by card is irrevocable. By submitting his or her bank card details, the User authorises Shadow US to (a)
								store
								his or her bank information pursuant to our Privacy Policy and (b) automatically debit his or her bank card for the
								amount corresponding to the price of the Service subscribed, on a recurring basis, until the subscription has been
								cancelled and all sums due have been fully paid. The User confirms that he or she is the holder of the bank card to
								be
								debited and that it is his or her name on the bank card. He or she shall provide the sixteen-digit bank card number
								and
								expiry date, and if necessary, the CVV number.</p>
							<p>The User is responsible for ensuring that the bank card used for the payments is valid, that the conditions of use
								applicable to the card permit monthly payments to be debited for the Services, and that there are sufficient funds
								in
								the bank account to be debited.</p>
							<p>If a payment is rejected, Shadow US will inform the User as soon as possible to rectify the situation.</p>
							<p>The company will not, in any case, be held responsible in the case where the User were to make the payment of sums
								due
								by means other than those formally accepted by the Company, it being understood that the payment would then not free
								him
								or her from his or her obligation and should be made again according to a means of payment available to the User to
								this
								end.</p>
						</div>
						<h3>Disputed charges</h3>
						<div>
							<p>If the User disputes a payment, a subscription charge, a fee or an interest charge, relating to the Services, for any
							reason, Shadow US reserves the right to suspend the User’s access to the Services until any and all such disputes are
							settled.</p>
							<p>In the case of a User disputing charges on the basis that the subscription or purchase of the Services was taken out in
							a fraudulent manner, Shadow US reserves the right to terminate the Services as of right and without notice, and to take
							any legal action it deems appropriate.</p>
						</div>
						<h3>Suspension of the account</h3>
						<div>
							<p>If payment is not made within three (3) calendar days, the User's access to the Service will be suspended. After this
								period of three (3) days, there is no guarantee that access to the Service will be provided again immediately after
								payment has been made. Moreover, if the User's access to the Services has been suspended as a result of late payment
								or
								non-payment, for any reason whatsoever, the full subscription fee shall remain due and the User will not be entitled
								to
								any refund in respect of the suspension period. If the Service is cancelled by Shadow US as a result of non-payment
								(see
								Termination), the full fee must be paid to Shadow US immediately, for the current period until the end of the
								Subscription Period.</p>
						</div>
						<h3>Late payment fee</h3>
						<div>
							<p>In the event of late payment, the User will be liable to pay a lump-sum late payment fee equal to five (5) US dollars if
							the second attempt to debit the account fails. If payment is not made after thirty (30) calendar days, the full sum due
							will bear an interest of 10% (ten percent) per annum, in addition to the lump sum payment. The interest will be charged
							for each fifteen (15) day-period until the amount owed has been paid in full. Each fifteen (15) day-period started must
							be paid in full. The User authorises Shadow US to debit his or her bank card for the amount corresponding to the late
							payment fee and/or the interest, at the same time as payment of the subscription fee or by means of a separate payment,
							or to use any other means of payment chosen by the User to pay for his or her subscription fees.</p>
						</div>
						<h3>Reimbursement</h3>
						<p>If the User is refunded by Shadow US, the reimbursement will be made, where possible, using the same means of payment
						used by the User to pay for his or her subscription fees. If the means of payment used is no longer valid, the User must
						inform Shadow US of this before the refund is made to this means of payment. In particular, if the User has changed bank
						branch, he or she must contact his or her former bank branch to ensure that the transfer has in fact been made to the
						new account or the funds have been deposited in a suspense account. The payment made by Shadow US to the bank card or
						bank account provided by the User will release the Company from its commitment to the User.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h2>Change of subscription plan; Subscription to options</h2>
						<p>Shadow US allows Users to subscribe to one or more options, or to change their subscription plan via their User
							Account.</p>
						<p>Unless otherwise indicated by Shadow US at the time of subscription to the options concerned, subscriptions to new
							options or changes in subscription plan requested by the User will take immediate effect (or within a reasonable
							time
							limit) and will be billed to the User on a pro rata basis, from the date the options or changes in subscription plan
							are
							activated, for a superior plan, until the end of the current Subscription Period. These options will be tacitly
							renewed
							in the same way as the main offer. For the terms on cancelling the options or changing to an inferior subscription
							plan,
							see Change of subscription plan; Cancellation of options.</p>
						<p>The options will be billed on top of the main subscription offer.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
						<p>The good working of the Services, including open posting areas, such as forums and help centres, implies and requires
						that the User will use them in a reasonable and responsible way. In particular, the right to access a Shadow® remote
						computer provided by Shadow US as part of its Services is a right reserved exclusively to the User, for his or personal
						and private use, excluding, in particular, any commercial and/or business activity or purpose.</p>
						<p>The User is also prohibited from misusing the Services, or helping a third party to do so. In particular, but without
						limiting the foregoing, when using the Services, the User is prohibited from:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>advocating or perpetrating illegal activities of any kind, including any activities which would violate local, state,
							national, federal or international laws, rules and regulations;</li>
							<li>creating, uploading, linking or sharing fraudulent, defamatory or misleading content, or intending to incite crimes and
							offences, racial hate or suicide, justify crimes against humanity, or containing child pornography, or any other content
							of a violent or pornographic nature where the content could be accessed by minors;</li>
							<li>infringing any third party's copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret or other proprietary rights or rights of
							publicity or privacy, or using the Services to share copyrighted material that you do not own or have permission to
							share or distribute;</li>
							<li>hacking or attempting to hack into third-party computer systems, hosting botnet-type aggressive services, spreading,
							posting, distributing or otherwise making available or transmitting viruses, worms, spyware, time bombs, trojan horse,s,
							malwares, ransonwares, attacks (such as DDos, DoS, scanning, spamming, brute force, etc.), other harmful or destructive
							component, or other computer programmes with the purpose or effect of restricting, harming or altering the proper
							functioning of all the hardware or computer programmes;</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h2>Termination and suspension</h2>
						<ol>
							<li>
								<h3>Termination at Shadow US’s initiative</h3>
								<p>Shadow US reserves the right to automatically suspend the Services, without providing notice, in the event of a breach
								by the User of his or her legal obligations or these Conditions, and in particular in the event of violation of the Code
								of Conduct. Shadow US also reserves the right to suspend the <a href="#">Services</a> after sending the User a payment request in the
								case of late payment.</p>
								<p>Once the Service has been suspended and after formal notice has been sent to the User by e-mail and no response has been
								received within eight (8) days, Shadow US is also entitled to cancel the User's subscription by e-mail.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<h3>Termination at the User’s initiative</h3>
								<p>The User may end his or her subscription to the Services at any time, by sending a registered letter with
								acknowledgement of receipt, to the address stated for this purpose in the User Account or in the legal notices, or by
								any other means provided to the User for this purpose, notably in his or her User Account or by a message sent to the
								Support Department</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<h3>Termination consequences</h3>
								<p>In the event of termination at the initiative of Shadow US for breach of the Code of Conduct or for late payment, the
								data saved on all the storage disks of the remote computer (Main Disk and Additional Disk(s) if applicable), including
								the Data, will be completely deleted without delay.</p>
								<p>Irrespective of the reason for cancellation of the User's subscription to the Service, it is the User's responsibility
								to return the Terminal, if his or her subscription includes the provision or rental of a Terminal, in accordance with
								the conditions set out in the section <a href="#">Returning the Terminal</a>.</p>
